// healthcheck provides active and passive healthchecks to the 'service' inside the runner.
//
// Active Healthcheck
//
// With active healthcheck, its possible for services to produce/push its health status and
// consumes other services health status. If the service somehow depends on the other service
// status and its affect on how the service is running, it then can set its own status to
// either degraded or unhealthy depends on the condition. The point of active healthcheck
// is to give an immediate notification and propagation for other services.
